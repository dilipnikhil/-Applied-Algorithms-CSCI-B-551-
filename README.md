This repository consists of my Applied Algorithms (CSCI-B 551) Assignments and Lab questions and answers. 
The topics that are covered in the class are Data Structures, Algorithms, Amortized Analysis, Dynamic Programming, Streaming and Randomized Algorithms, Huffman Coding, Greedy Algorithms and Graphs. 

I will keep updating this as the semester progresses.
